Description: This package contains a library implementing a simple but
  powerful template language for C++.  It emphasizes separating logic
  from presentation: it is impossible to embed application logic in this
  template language.  The devel package contains static and debug
  libraries and header files for developing applications that use the
  ctemplate package.

Package: libctemplate0
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Description: This package contains a library implementing a simple but
  powerful template language for C++.  It emphasizes separating logic
  from presentation: it is impossible to embed application logic in this
  template language.  This limits the power of the template language
  without limiting the power of the template *system*.  Indeed, Google's
  "main" web search uses this system exclusively for formatting output.
