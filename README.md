## MailCore 2: Introduction ##

MailCore 2 provides a simple and asynchronous Objective-C API to work with the e-mail protocols **IMAP**, **POP** and **SMTP**. The API has been redesigned from the ground up.  It features:

- **POP**, **IMAP** and **SMTP** support
- **[RFC822](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt)** parser and generator
- **Asynchronous** APIs
- **HTML** rendering of messages
- **iOS** and **Mac** support

## Basic IMAP Usage ##

Using MailCore 2 is just a little more complex conceptually than the original MailCore.  All fetch requests in MailCore 2 are made asynchronously through a queue.  What does this mean?  Well, let's take a look at a simple example:

```swift
  let session = MCOIMAPSession()
  
  session.hostname       = "imap.gmail.com"
  session.port           = 993
  session.username       = "ADDRESS@gmail.com"
  session.password       = "123456"
  session.connectionType = .TLS
  
  let folder = "INBOX"
  let uids   = MCOIndexSet(range: MCORange(location: 1, length: UInt64.max))
  
  if let fetchOperation = session.fetchMessagesOperation(withFolder: folder, requestKind: .headers, uids: uids) {
    fetchOperation.start { error, fetchedMessages, vanishedMessages in
      // We've finished downloading the messages!
      
      // Let's check if there was an error
      if let error = error {
        print("Error downloading message headers: \(error.localizedDescription)")
      }
      
      // And, let's print out the messages:
      print("The post man delivereth: \(fetchedMessages.debugDescription)")
    }
  }
```

In this sample, we retrieved and printed a list of email headers from an IMAP server.  In order to execute the fetch, we request an asynchronous operation object from the `MCOIMAPSession` instance with our parameters (more on this later).  This operation object is able to initiate a connection to Gmail when we call the `start` method.  Now here's where things get a little tricky.  We call the `start` function with a block, which is executed on the main thread when the fetch operation completes.  The actual fetching from IMAP is done on a **background thread**, leaving your UI and other processing **free to use the main thread**.
